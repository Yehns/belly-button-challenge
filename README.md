Module 14

Module 14 requires the selection of data from a .json file to create two graphs, a bar and bubble chart. The associated data also includes metadata which is displayed after a new selection of an ID from the dropdown menu. 
Each “Test Subject ID” has a unique array of data which has been selected to develop the graphs. The top 10 OTU’s and each patient’s sample are displayed on the dashboard and can be seamlessly selected and displayed.
